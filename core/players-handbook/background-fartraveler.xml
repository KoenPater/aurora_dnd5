			<p>Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter in the world have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born.</p>
			<p class="indent">You aren't one of those folk.</p>
			<p class="indent">You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of the world for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land’s ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li> <strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Insight, Perception</li>
				<li> <strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland</li>
				<li> <strong>Languages:</strong> Any one of your choice</li>
				<li> <strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of traveler's clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in the world, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland's craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>WHY ARE YOU HERE?</h5>
			<p>A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr> <td>d6</td> <td>Reason</td> <td>d6</td> <td>Reason</td> </tr>
				</thead>
				<tr> <td>1</td> <td>Emissary</td> <td>4</td> <td>Pilgrim</td> </tr>
				<tr> <td>2</td> <td>Exile</td> <td>5</td> <td>Sightseer</td> </tr>
				<tr> <td>3</td> <td>Fugitive</td> <td>6</td> <td>Wanderer</td> </tr>
			</table>
			<h5>WHERE ARE YOU FROM?</h5>
			<p>The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. Ask your DM if you're not sure what a sufficient homeland would be for your character.

			<p>Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.</p>
